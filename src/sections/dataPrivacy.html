    <p>
      We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data
      protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the
      Agentur Baumeister. The use of the Internet pages of the Agentur
      Baumeister is possible without any indication of personal data; however,
      if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our
      website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the
      processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis
      for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.<br />
      The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail
      address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line
      with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with
      the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Agentur
      Baumeister. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise
      would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose
      of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data
      subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of
      the rights to which they are entitled.<br />
      As the controller, the Agentur Baumeister has implemented numerous
      technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete
      protection of personal data processed through this website. However,
      Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so
      absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data
      subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means,
      e.g. by telephone.<br />

        The data protection declaration of the Agentur Baumeister is based on
        the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the
        General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection
        declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public,
        as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would
        like to first explain the terminology used. In this data protection
        declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:

          an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An
          identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
          indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a
          name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or
          to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological,
          genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural
          person.
        </li>
        <li>
          b) Data subject<br />Data subject is any identified or identifiable
          natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller
          responsible for the processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          c) Processing<br />Processing is any operation or set of operations
          which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data,
          whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording,
          organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration,
          retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission,
          dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination,
          restriction, erasure or destruction.
        </li>
        <li>
          d) Restriction of processing<br />Restriction of processing is the
          marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their
          processing in the future.
        </li>
        <li>
          e) Profiling<br />Profiling means any form of automated processing of
          personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate
          certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular
          to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's
          performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences,
          interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.
        </li>
        <li>
          f) Pseudonymisation<br />Pseudonymisation is the processing of
          personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be
          attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional
          information, provided that such additional information is kept
          separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to
          ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or
          identifiable natural person.
        </li>
        <li>
          g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing<br />Controller
          or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal
          person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly
          with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of
          personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are
          determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the
          specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or
          Member State law.

          i) Recipient<br />Recipient is a natural or legal person, public
          authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are
          disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities
          which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular
          inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be
          regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public
          authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection
          rules according to the purposes of the processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          j) Third party<br />Third party is a natural or legal person, public
          authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller,
          processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the
          controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
          k) Consent<br />Consent of the data subject is any freely given,
          specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's
          wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative
          action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data
          relating to him or her.

      <p>
        The website of the Agentur Baumeister collects a series of general data
        and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the
        website. This general data and information are stored in the server log
        files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the
        operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from
        which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4)
        the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site,
        (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service
        provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and
        information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information
        technology systems.<br />
        When using these general data and information, the Agentur Baumeister
        does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this
        information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website
        correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its
        advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information
        technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law
        enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal
        prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the Agentur Baumeister
        analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with
        the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our
        enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the
        personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are
        stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.

        storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or
        other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is
        subject to. If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage
        period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent
        legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in
        accordance with legal requirements.

        </li>
        <ul class="list-disc ps-10">
          <li>
            The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the
            purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.
          </li>
          <li>
            The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based
            according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of
            Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground
            for the processing.
          </li>
          <li>
            The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1)
            of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the
            processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant
            to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.
          </li>
          <li>The personal data have been unlawfully processed.</li>
          <li>
            The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal
            obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is
            subject.
          </li>
          <li>
            The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of
            information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the
            GDPR.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject
          wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored by the Agentur
          Baumeister, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the
          controller. An employee of Agentur Baumeister shall promptly ensure
          that the erasure request is complied with immediately. <br />Where the
          controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to
          Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking
          account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall
          take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other
          controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has
          requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or
          replication of, those personal data, as far as processing is not
          required. An employees of the Agentur Baumeister will arrange the
          necessary measures in individual cases.

          e) Right of restriction of processing <br />Each data subject shall
          have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the
          controller restriction of processing where one of the following
          applies:
        </li>
        <ul class="list-disc ps-10">
          <li>
            The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject,
            for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the
            personal data.
          </li>
          <li>
            The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure
            of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their
            use instead.
          </li>
          <li>
            The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of
            the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the
            establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
          </li>
          <li>
            The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article
            21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate
            grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject
          wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data
          stored by the Agentur Baumeister, he or she may at any time contact
          any employee of the controller. The employee of the Agentur Baumeister
          will arrange the restriction of the processing.
