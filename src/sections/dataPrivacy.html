    <p>
      We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data
      protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the
      Agentur Baumeister. The use of the Internet pages of the Agentur
      Baumeister is possible without any indication of personal data; however,
      if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our
      website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the
      processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis
      for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.<br />
      The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail
      address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line
      with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with
      the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Agentur
      Baumeister. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise
      would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose
      of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data
      subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of
      the rights to which they are entitled.<br />
      As the controller, the Agentur Baumeister has implemented numerous
      technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete
      protection of personal data processed through this website. However,
      Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so
      absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data
      subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means,
      e.g. by telephone.<br />

        The data protection declaration of the Agentur Baumeister is based on
        the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the
        General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection
        declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public,
        as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would
        like to first explain the terminology used. In this data protection
        declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:

          a) Personal data<br />Personal data means any information relating to
          an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An
          identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
          indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a
          name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or
          to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological,
          genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural
          person.

        <li>
          b) Data subject<br />Data subject is any identified or identifiable
          natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller
          responsible for the processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          c) Processing<br />Processing is any operation or set of operations
          which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data,
          whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording,
          organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration,
          retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission,
          dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination,
          restriction, erasure or destruction.
        </li>
        <li>
          d) Restriction of processing<br />Restriction of processing is the
          marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their

        </li>
        <li>
          e) Profiling<br />Profiling means any form of automated processing of
          personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate
          certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular
          to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's
          performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences,
          interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.
        </li>
        <li>
          f) Pseudonymisation<br />Pseudonymisation is the processing of
          personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be
          attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional
          information, provided that such additional information is kept
          separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to
          ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or
          identifiable natural person.
        </li>
        <li>
          g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing<br />Controller
          or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal
          person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly
          with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of
          personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are
          determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the
          specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or
          Member State law.

          i) Recipient<br />Recipient is a natural or legal person, public
          authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are
          disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities
          which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular
          inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be
          regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public
          authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection
          rules according to the purposes of the processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          j) Third party<br />Third party is a natural or legal person, public

        </li>
        <li>
          k) Consent<br />Consent of the data subject is any freely given,
          specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's
          wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative
          action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data
          relating to him or her.

      <li>Collection of general data and information</li>
      <p>
        The website of the Agentur Baumeister collects a series of general data
        and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the
        website. This general data and information are stored in the server log
        files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the
        operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from
        which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4)
        the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site,
        (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service
        provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and
        information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information
        technology systems.<br />
        When using these general data and information, the Agentur Baumeister
        does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this
        information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website
        correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its
        advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information
        technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law
        enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal
        prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the Agentur Baumeister
        analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with
        the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our
        enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the
        personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are
        stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.
